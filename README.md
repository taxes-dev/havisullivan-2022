Repository for my professional web site. 

## Building and Running

You'll need the [current Node.js packages](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (16.x or later). Then execute:

```
npm install
```

Once it's setup, you can run `npm run build` to compile the site into the `_site` folder or `npm start` to start a local development server.
