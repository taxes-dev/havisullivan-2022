## Technology Team & Product Leadership

I have over two decades of experience in a wide variety of technologies, most recently focusing on **massively scalable Internet platforms** and **developer support and SDKs**. I want to create software products that connect players and to challenge myself and my teams to reach new levels.

What do I bring to a team?

 * **Team leadership & organization design.** I love mentoring and developing multi-disciplinary teams as well as growing the next generation of leaders. I’ve built and led organizations up to 30 people.
 * **Software design and implementation.** I’ve walked the path of monolith to n-tier to SOA to cloud microservices. I have a great depth of technological literacy, building online services, SDKs, and desktop and mobile applications. I’m eager to learn new platforms and languages as needed.
 * **Technical project and product management.** I can build and maintain client relationships, delivery schedules, and product backlogs with specific expertise in technical products.
