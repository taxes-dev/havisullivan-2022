    <h1 class="title">Blizzard Rebrand Project</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Starting in late 2016, Blizzard Entertainment began execution on a project to unify the brand online under
            Blizzard rather
            than Battle.net. Alongside this rebrand effort, my team was tasked with setting the direction for the
            Blizzard brand
            on the web and on mobile. Twelve months later, my small team of four software engineers and two graphic
            designers launched
            the final of five new products.</p>
        <p>My main contributions for all of these projects was to set the product vision for each one, work closely with
            the designers
            on user experience, and set a roadmap where we could deliver all of them by the end of 2017.</p>

    <h2 class="is-size-4">Blizzard Careers</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The first web site to be revamped was
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315024938/https://careers.blizzard.com/en-us/"
                target="_blank">Blizzard Careers (archive link)</a>, launching in December 2016. Previously, this was a
            subsection of the main blizzard.com web site.
            The new site is standalone and features links to articles about working at Blizzard, in-depth descriptions
            of our offices
            and disciplines, and a section dedicated to new graduates and interns. Blizzard Careers was also the first
            site to use
            our updated styleguide for all Blizzard-branded properties.

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="is-size-4">Global Navigation</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The new global navigation component was the most challenging of all the projects. Essentially every web site
            team across
            Blizzard acted as a stakeholder and customer on this project. This created a lot of conflicts between
            different teams
            whose requirements came into odds with each other, and I had to negotiate how the final product would work.
            Also, we
            had to support two different tech stacks: Node.js and Java/Spring.</p>
        <p>The major opportunity here, though, was to formally productize this component. Previously it had been treated
            as a shared
            asset, meaning engineers from all over the company would commit changes to it without any sort of change
            management,
            continually destabilizing the codebase. Now it is controlled by one team who fields both new feature
            requests as well
            as ongoing product support. We even have a formal SLA for supporting past versions.</p>
        <p>We launched this product in March 2017, and I still get compliments a year later from around the company for
            how I handled
            this project and how easy it is to integrate with the new navigation component.</p>

    <h2 class="is-size-4">Blizzard News</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Before
            <a href="https://news.blizzard.com" target="_blank">Blizzard News</a> launched in June 2017, the only place
            to read all of the news across Blizzard was in the desktop launcher.
            Now there is an optimized experience for both desktop and mobile web.
        </p>
        <p>Blizzard News was also my team's first experience with deploying a web experience
            <a href="https://news.blz.cn/zh-cn" target="_blank">in Chinese infrastructure</a>. This had a lot of
            technical and legal hurdles we had to learn and overcome together.

    <h2 class="is-size-4">Blizzard.com</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The centerpiece of the rebrand project was the relaunch of
            <a href="https://www.blizzard.com" target="_blank">Blizzard.com</a>. Debuting in October of 2017, it was
            ready just in time for BlizzCon and represented the first major
            update to that site since it was last updated in 2009. This new version is more player-focused, showing
            Blizzard’s games
            and news, instead of just showing a list of press releases.
        </p>
        <p>Building on our experience Blizzard News, we also launched
            <a href="https://blz.cn/zh-cn/" target="_blank">this site in China</a>, representing Blizzard's first
            corporate web site presence in that country.

    <h2 class="is-size-4">Blizzard Esports</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Wrapping up in December 2017, we launched the final product needed to build out our new Blizzard brand
            platform,
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180221003239/https://esports.blizzard.com/en-us/"
                target="_blank">Blizzard Esports (archive link)
            </a>. This site was created specifically to solve a discoverability problem with Blizzard’s myriad of
            esports programs
            across all of our franchises. Later on, we plan to expand the site with much more content and useful
            information for
            Blizzard esports fans.
