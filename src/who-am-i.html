    <h1 class="title"> Who is Havi Sullivan?</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>I love building great technology solutions, especially when I get to build platforms and applications that
            can support millions of eager customers. I enjoy working with commerce and payment systems, web
            technologies, platform services and APIs, SDKs, tools, and games. I lead and develop my teams to build the
            very best technology products in the industry.</p>

        <p>Over the years, I’ve worn many hats, starting out my career as a graphic designer and web developer. Along
            the way I accumulated a variety of skills, including server and client applications development, team
            leadership, and even product management. I thrive in roles where I can collaborate with others and exercise
            many different skillsets to solve complex problems.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">What do I do?</h2>

    <div class="content">
        <p>With a background in software engineering and years of experience with a variety of platforms and
            applications, I’ve accrued a vast depth of knowledge from many closely related disciplines. I am an
            archetypical example of a generalizing specialist or versatilist. Today I spend most of my attention on
            leading amazing development teams and setting the vision and direction for our products and the
            organization, though I still like to dive into software architecture and code as time permits.</p>

        <p>Let me describe the kinds of things I love to do (and that I’m really good at).</p>

        <p><strong>High-level decision making.</strong> I’m keenly aware that I’m not the smartest person in the room,
            and I work hard to make every voice at the table heard. That said, after I’ve collected all the feedback,
            I’m not afraid to make the hard decisions and be accountable for the outcome.</p>

        <p><strong>I’m a natural diplomat.</strong> Whether it’s leading a team or negotiating with stakeholders, I can
            maneuver tricky situations with grace and tact. In fact, my personality type is known as <a
                href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“the
                Mediator,”</a> and the summary I just linked is probably 90-95% accurate to me personally.</p>

        <p><strong>I love leading and developing teams.</strong> Working with cross-discipline teams made up of product
            managers, engineers, designers, and testers, I enjoy spending time with each team member, discovering their
            strengths and bringing them to the forefront. I can work with people at all stages of their career, from
            intern to senior, and I have a drive to grow tomorrow’s leaders.</p>

        <p><strong>Software with longevity is my passion.</strong> Regardless of my actual role or project, I love
            working with systems that are built to last. This could be a platform meant to support many players or a
            live game meant to extend its life well beyond box sales. I have a vision for the future and don’t build
            throw-away products.</p>

        <p><strong>Learning is a core theme of my career.</strong> I enjoy work that constantly throws new challenges at
            me and requires me to learn and grow every day. Software is a fast-paced field with many opportunities to
            explore both established and emerging tools and pick the best one for the job.</p>

        <p>I back up my technology expertise with a customer-oriented vision.** Years of immersion in some of the best
            cross-discipline teams in the business have taught me a lot about products, marketing, infrastructure,
            operations, you name it. I can see the big picture and apply it to every step of the SDLC.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">My personal values</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>I have a core set of personal values that I’ve developed over the years. It’s important for me that any
            prospective employer has clearly defined values that resonate with my own and that they embody those values
            every day both in public and behind closed doors.</p>

        <p><strong>Be curious and open to change.</strong> I want to be learn constantly and engage new opinions. I try
            not to jump right to solutions that worked in the past since I might miss a new and better way of doing
            things.</p>

        <p><strong>Do what is right and take care of your people.</strong> Honesty and integrity are crucial to all
            interactions both business and personal. I try to be my true self, even when it’s not comfortable. I extend
            that to my team, allowing them to act in the ways that they believe are right, and I support them.</p>

        <p><strong>Be the best you that you can be.</strong> It sounds a bit cliché, but I really do try to be the best
            person I can in any given situation, and I always do my best work within the given constraints. If it’s
            worth doing, then it’s worth doing in a way I will be proud of afterwards.</p>
