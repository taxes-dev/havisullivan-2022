            <p>I have over two decades of experience in a wide variety of technologies, most recently focusing on
                <strong>massively
                    scalable Internet platforms</strong> and <strong>developer support and SDKs</strong>. I want to
                create
                software products that
                connect customers and to challenge myself and my teams to reach new levels.

            <h2 class="is-size-5">What do I bring to a team?</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical product management.</strong> I can build and maintain client relationships,
                    delivery schedules, and product roadmaps with specific expertise in technical products and
                    developers as customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Team leadership &amp; organization design.</strong> I love mentoring and developing
                    multi-disciplinary teams as well as growing the next generation of leaders. I’ve built and led
                    organizations up to 30 people.</li>
                <li><strong>Software design and implementation.</strong> I’ve walked the path of monolith to n-tier to
                    SOA to cloud microservices. I have a great depth of technological literacy, building online
                    services, SDKs, and applications for desktop, mobile, and game consoles, as well as e-commerce on
                    web.</li>
