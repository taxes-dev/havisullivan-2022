            <p>I have over two decades of experience in a wide variety of technologies, most recently focusing on
                <strong>massively
                    scalable Internet platforms</strong> and <strong>developer support and SDKs</strong>. I want to
                create
                software products that
                connect players and to challenge myself and my teams to reach new levels.

            <h2 class="is-size-5">What do I bring to a team?</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Team leadership &amp; organization design.</strong> I love mentoring and developing
                    multi-disciplinary teams as well as growing the next generation of leaders. I’ve built and led
                    organizations
                    up to 30 people.</li>
                <li><strong>Software design and implementation.</strong> I’ve walked the path of monolith to n-tier to
                    SOA
                    to
                    cloud microservices. I have a great depth of technological literacy, building online services, SDKs,
                    and
                    desktop and mobile applications. I’m eager to learn new platforms and languages as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical project and product management.</strong> I can build and maintain client
                    relationships,
                    delivery schedules, and product backlogs with specific expertise in technical products.</li>
